Business/Finance,impact gst invoicing thus revenue profit organization operating india exploring one factor impacting economy right,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4mq0p/the_impact_of_gst_on_invoicing_and_thus_on/,46,tl dr gst organization bill client state involved gst norm gst required one bill mean multiple bill depending number state involved could go high 36 bill 29 state + 7 union territory mean pregst x effort required make 100 rupee requires nx effort 1 36 make 100 rupee meaning work required make amount money increased 100 3500 impacted profit company thus economy begin expert taxation business guy working b2b sale indian mnc 3 5 year career largely postgst experienced pregst era well constantly deal gst numerous requirement objective highlight major roadblock many business folk encountered due gst feel aspect playing big role slowdown time left largely unexplored till grassroot nature problem people higher encounter directly anyone encounter would understand gravity problem aka reporter etc reiterate trying debate improvement vat merely highlight side gst hindering revenue profit thus business let start basic concept first 1 invoicing act giving bill product service utilized customer people simple receipt end meal instance checkout counter clothing store clothes purchased bill given cleaning service cleaning home organization invoice mean collect money client anything sold client generate invoice product delivered service rendered invoice also tax detail gst number billing address registered address shipping address list item need paid applicable tax cgst igst sgst payment due date authorized signature invoice mean collect cash client without proper invoice cash cannot collected problem start since proper invoice give lot ground client delay payment 2 process invoicing invoicing function organization product delivered service rendered sometimes delivered invoicing triggered meaning bill generated money collected client usually done erp like sap oracle invoice reach collection department collection manager submits invoice client verification payment collection manager front line people tasked bringing money organization one important people running business performance impact cash flow organization normally tagged account aka client one collection manager could handling anywhere one client thousand depending nature size client client verifies invoice money transferred selling organization becomes revenue subsequently profit client hold invoice reason becomes lost revenue bad debt loss selling organization longer client hold money lesser value money hold due concept timevalue money 100 rupee today considered money 100 rupee one month due timevalue money thus delayed payment impact profitability organization 3 gst service industry gst dictate invoicing service done state service delivered explain concept detail crux problem start outline simple sale sale would translate pregst postgst era problem statement assume tata motor intend buy 5000 chair office pepperfry 50 lakh rupee tata motor also want pepperfry install chair office 5 lakh rupee provide 5 year warranty including checkup every year determine life chair repair required 15 lakh rupee tata motor want chair delivered 50 office india across 20 different state mix product chair service installation maintenance total bill 70 lakh rupee 5000 chair inr 50 lakh installation chair 50 office across 20 state inr 5 lakh maintenance chair 5 year inr 15 lakh pepperfry sale executive take purchase order tata motor put order system input purcahse order trigger three function delivery product service b invoicing payment order c postsale service maintenance pregst invoicing gst came picture bill would generated pepperfry single bill centrally ie would generate bill 70 lakh extra relevant vat tax detail two organization would one single bill entire deal irrespective state city etc would give tata motor one single piece paper saying owed 70 lakh due date payment manoj pepperfrys collection manager tata motor submit single invoice tata motor office checked tata motor procurement finance team nothing wrong invoice payment cleared due date point focus one invoice needed delivery chair service entire country manoj submit one invoice follow invoice collect payment one invoice tata motor team verify one invoice process payment one invoice one tax number billing address needed invoice done centrally something wrong invoice manoj correct one invoice resubmit tata motor postgst invoicing like mentioned gst dictate invoicing done state service delivered ie separate gst filing state explaining mean separate invoice generated state involved transaction one state involved one invoice two state involved two invoice five state involved five invoice case since twenty state involved twenty invoice value invoice split direct proportion usage 100 r total bill value three state maharashtra kerala 603010 usage bill maharashtra 60 30 kerala 10 sense separate company state term gst moving implication tata motor pepperfry transaction since chair delivered 20 state tata motor pepperfry registered office twenty state along gst number state tata motor issue 20 purchase order proportionate value pepperfry ie 70 lakh split proportionally 20 state sale executive enter twenty purchase order system delivery triggered 20 state 20 different invoice handed manoj generation manoj submit 20 invoice pepperfry whose procurement department verify 20 invoice give finance verify initiate 20 payment 20 payment received tata motor 20 banking transaction id manoj verify 20 payment close transaction ideal scenario might able tell effort required everyone involved deal gone 20 time effort required one state involved buying side ie maharastra selling maharashtra twice effort two state involved buying side ie maharashtra selling kerala possibility going upto 36 time effort required previously amount money since 29 state 7 union territory yes union territory treated separately well impact 1 efficiency effort pepperfry still going make 70 lakh deal effort required twenty time tata motor give 20 purchase order 20 invoice generated time taken process invoice value impact time taken collect money invoice template value different example maharashtra chair inr 5 lakh installation inr 50k support inr 1 5 lakh kerala chair inr 3 lakh installation inr 30k support inr 90k chair inr 10 lakh installation inr 1 lakh support inr 3 lakh total money collected sale executive manoj procurement guy finance guy 20 time work added value efficiency scenario gone 5 arguably go 2 7 state union territory involved although rare case also like said ideal scenario always go smoothly challenge encountered incorrect proportion purchase order invoice someone made mistake 10 needed allocated allocated 11 15 process repeated finding fault b incorrect gst po invoice suppose particular invoice wrong gst mean processed incorrect tax information mean money collected invoice gst would one wrong tax number could one two twenty mistake happen real life one common thing face mistake happened gst well happen multiple really expect people make mistake always efficiency go multiple time effort required fix mistake c missing gst necessary company gst registration every state tata motor might registered office 2 state example ie gst number provide declaration pepperfry saying gst number two state pepperfry able give invoice payment money delayed till getting declaration experience take long time tata motor say able claim input tax credit state like leaving money table getting declaration basically saying willing lose money transaction requires approval upto highest level loss company manoj follow two time consuming thing get amount money thus efficiency go 2 cash flow cash lifeline company company without cash cannot survive could valued billion dollar cash pay employee shut kingfisher could pay employee interest vendor cash left jet cash payment salary fuel loan payment etc bsnl struggling pay thing cash thus healthy cash flow one important aspect business survival company company people cash flow would oxygen invoicing cash brought company decrease efficiency collection manager delay introduced collection cash pregst cash collected 25 day would taking say 45 day collection manager efficiency gone tiny delay add incorrect gst add another 7 day cash collected missing gst add 15 day etc two outcome firstly pepperfry earlier predicted get money 30 day receiving 45 day mean 70 lakh need 30th day daily expense need found somewhere else since 70 day coming another 2 week dip reserve 15 day secondly money lost value 70 lakh end 30 day since time passed lost value due time value money could generated interest could invested delayed hence value lost loss pepperfry summarize gst delayed payment cycle company take longer collect amount money used gst introduced money take longer come take longer go salary interest payment vendor payment outflow impacted 3 profit profit made deal varies company company deal deal let u assume pepperfry made 10 profit deal ie 7 lakh due following factor profit get impacted payment cycle delayed collecting profit longer duration collect 63 lakh start making profit could say collected 13 20 invoice remaining 7 give profit basically profit generation delayed cash flow delayed mean profit made deal lost value pregst 7 lakh le 7 lakh value due time value money efficiency gone effort required generate amount profit gone thus profit deal actually gone b 20 invoice process always go many get stuck payment delayed may never come due process issue money linger never come pepperfry become bad debt invoice get stuck reason like incorrect gst missing gst incorrect value cash collected invoice amount get reduced profit invoice gotten processed 7 lakh profit le say 5 lakh 7 lakh collected deal pepperfry actually make loss deal biggest culprit psu like hpcl bpcl ubi etc requirement stringent single mistake hold invoice payment could get delayed year thus profit deal impacted pay till everything invoice correct could delay multiple reason many business sell psu reason profit cash get stuck business different pregst earlier say mistake one invoice fix could many amount revenue chance make amount profit thus due lowered efficiency longer payment cycle stuck payment profit made gotten impacted conclusion ramblings due statespecific nature gst effort required make amount money pregst era gone impacted revenue thus profit made company problem everyone face gst want business multiple state ready face challenge feel free discus impact economy opinion big impact

economy world stopped using dollar impact brics u many war middle east supposedly oil never really take oil u rich 800 military base around world defence budget larger rest world combined country still hold u dollar reserve u trillion dollar debt much debt u economy still afloat thought putting together anyone else may want learn gleaned reading matter economist anyone want correct anything would welcome accept criticism reference material substantiating point 1944 country entered bretton wood agreement basically said world currrecies would backed u dollar u dollar would backed gold country could convert currency u dollar redeem u gold exchange rate 35 dollar per ounce gold since u largest gold reserve time 75 entire world gold everyone agreed also allowed u treasury fix exchange rate dollar different currency set interest rate interbanking transaction etc however multiple war u 60 caused domestic inflation u value dollar fall caused panic country started redeeming gold u treasury u gold fell 20 000 tonne 8100 tonne quickly thus 1971 nixon closed gold window e suspended ability nation redeem u gold dollar took gold backing u dollar allowed u retain gold reserve made need u dollar among country non existent everyone started move away dollar u economy started spiral price gold became 135 dollar per ounce top arab world hiked oil price u desperately needed stabilize spiral brokered deal saudi oil producer would trade oil nothing u dollar convince opec middle eastern north african oil producing country also invest opec oil profit u treasury buying u treasury bond basically mean opec buying u debt u printing dollar amount foreign investment u treasury made oil producing nation oil profit basically profit every barrel sold opec make way u treasury become value dollar printed ultimately profit oil stronger dollar lesser profit oil weaker dollar thus u get double benefit every barrel oil way exchange u would sell saudi advance weapon gold demanded basically weapon gold sale exchange trading oil dollar prop u dollar gold still propping u dollar indirectly forcing oil producer trade dollar thus petrodollar born caused world need u dollar wanted buy oil needed u dollar either converting currency selling stuff u latter preferred cheaper exchanging currency also grows economy u became benchmark international trade since country hope grow economy without using energy aka oil cant oil without u dollar long country need oil u print dollar thin air balance oil barrel explained without actually even owning single drop oil country need gold balance currency u need control oil need control currency traded keep economy afloat later u foreign policy similarly u bokered deal latin american country trade u dollar also give precedence u eu japanese product trade country decide shun dollar trade currency would eventually cause opec switch well dollar could collapse well u basically printing enormous amount money thin air money used domestically much larger extent globally international oil trade dollar stop people stop needing dollar use currency internationally circulating dollar would come back u many dollar little amount treasury would cause hyperinflation economic spiral however logical next step would destroy excess dollar coming abroad would keep country economy afloat okay remember dollar printed foreign investment treasury profit oil trade dollar would go away well essentially leaving nothing treasury dollar valued hence dollar literally worth money printed second since u currency basically petrodollar power depends control oil right whoever control middle east major power today saudi arabia control middle east u control saudi arabia ussaudi brotherhood sort make impossible country influence russia tried decade establish strong foothold middle east unsuccessful also dictated u foreign policy far last 5 decade like said u need control oil reserve currency oil traded hence war hear oil actually oil per se intimidation tactic country announced would longer accept dollar currency international oil trade egs ayatollah iran announced intention denounce dollar oil trade use currency instead u backed iraq go war iran even provided weapon mass destruction use iran later used excuse invade iraq prosecuted saddam hussein iraq invaded kuwait major producer oil able pay loan kuwait later asked euro used oil trade rather petrodollar u invaded iraq gaddafi asked gold based dinar instead u dollar oil trade u invaded libya chavez u staged coup venezuela however starting nonpetro currency would break link oil middle east would become le relevant economic power interest energy concern still important le economic geopolitical chessboard u today may actually solution achieving peace middle east however another thing happens middle east control price oil tied dollar recently middle east opec basically saudi arabia decided drop international price economic reason country oil production major source revenue trade dollar eg many n african country venezuela seen economy completely stabilise destroyed country sick u saudi controlling market way affect country adversely hence country switching international trading system gold based currency cause economy stabilise international reserve eu etc hand seen increased holding opec country worried increasing power country international banking system would glad get rid holding non dollar currency would cause fall u dollar value lieu another thing need considered lot developing country international trade deficit trade deficit currency country debt owed internationally accepted currency eg dollar debt dollar conversion interest rate borrowing determined according rule u treasury rate u treasury linked value dollar country giving loan prefer dollar historically dollar strong trusted collapse hence money owe safe country taking loan also convert debt dollar easier country debt owed cannot change value debt owed manipulating currency dollar determined conversion currency fixed rate safe everyone however slight problem owe debt 1 dollar someone pay debt depend value dollar currency particular instant dollar gotten stronger wrt currency shall pay money dollar gotten weaker owe le money currency hence fall dollar would beneficial country owe debt dollar bad country loaned debt dollar also taking debt dollar becomes cheaper value dollar fall since u treasury interest rate directly tied dollar hence becomes cheaper borrow dollar also said grows weaker still yo owe le money one thing consider regarding fall dollar uptil oil producer buying u treasury bond due bretton wood deal country u corporation u treasury give fixed rate interest investing treasury rate turn linked value dollar stronger dollar interest u treasury bond foreign country invest mean foreign country would much rather invest money u treasury assured fixed rate interest invest 3rd world country take risk maybe losing however value dollar fall country would much rather draw u treasury invest startup different country domestically etc side coin would country dependent u investment value dollar fall investment received u would lesser value hand one thinh like said investment dollar governed u treasury rule basically u bank cut tax money transfer conversion artificially keeping low fuel domestic world trade etc dollar collapse people wouldnt trade dollar would trade currency inetrbanking across world would governed rule currency trade eg brics nation follow tariff etc shanghai bank reserve held effect would depend rule bank deal detrimental beneficial depending bank policy compared dollar also country holding u treasury would lose entire value foreign reserve hand coountries like brics reserve international bank would
